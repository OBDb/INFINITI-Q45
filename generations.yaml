generations:
  - name: "First Generation (G50)"
    start_year: 1990
    end_year: 1996
    description: "The original Infiniti Q45 was the brand's flagship luxury sedan, introduced when Infiniti launched in the United States. Featuring distinctive, minimalist styling that eschewed the chrome grilles and traditional luxury cues common to the segment, it took a more performance-oriented approach than most competitors. Powered by a 4.5L V8 engine producing 278 HP, paired with a four-speed automatic transmission, it offered impressive performance for its time. The rear-wheel drive platform featured an independent multi-link suspension and available active suspension system (HICAS) that delivered excellent handling for a large luxury sedan. The interior was similarly unconventional, with a minimalist design lacking wood trim and featuring a clock as the dashboard centerpiece rather than the traditional analog clock found in luxury vehicles. This generation established the Q45 as a driver-focused alternative to the more traditional Lexus LS400 and German luxury flagships, though its unconventional approach and Infiniti's low brand recognition limited its commercial success despite critical acclaim for its driving dynamics."

  - name: "Second Generation (FY33)"
    start_year: 1997
    end_year: 2001
    description: "The second-generation Q45 adopted a more conventional luxury approach, abandoning the minimalist styling of its predecessor for a more traditional design with a proper grille and increased chrome accents. Built on an updated platform, it was shorter but wider than the first generation, with slightly reduced interior space but improved rigidity. Powered by a new 4.1L V8 engine producing 266 HP, paired with a four-speed automatic transmission, it focused more on refinement than raw performance. The interior featured a significant shift toward traditional luxury with extensive wood trim, softer leather, and more conventional controls. This generation represented Infiniti's attempt to appeal to a broader luxury audience by adopting design elements and comfort features similar to successful competitors like Lexus. However, the more conservative approach combined with reduced power compared to its predecessor resulted in a vehicle that was less distinctive in the market, contributing to modest sales figures that fell short of Infiniti's expectations."

  - name: "Third Generation (F50)"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The final generation of the Q45 returned to a more performance-oriented approach while maintaining traditional luxury elements. Featuring more aggressive styling with a distinctive grille and sharper lines, it adopted some of the sporting character that would later define Infiniti's brand identity. Powered by a new 4.5L V8 engine producing 340 HP, paired with a five-speed automatic transmission, it offered competitive performance against established luxury flagships. The interior combined luxury with technology, featuring one of the first production-car implementations of intelligent cruise control, rearview camera, voice recognition, and LED headlights. Available with an adaptive front lighting system that would swivel the headlights during turns, it showcased Infiniti's focus on innovative technology. Despite these advancements and generally positive reviews, the third-generation Q45 struggled to gain traction in a market increasingly dominated by German luxury brands and the Lexus LS. Production ended in 2006 without a direct replacement, as Infiniti shifted focus to its more successful G and M (later Q50 and Q70) models. The Q45 nameplate was eventually succeeded conceptually by the Q70, though the latter never achieved the flagship status or technological innovation that characterized the original Q45."
